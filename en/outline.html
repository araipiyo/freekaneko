<div class="main">
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Isamu Kaneko experimentally created 'Winny' which has more efficiency than previous anonymous P2P software such as Freenet. Winny has anonymous efficient file-sharing feature. Winny was getting very famous with helps of websites or books which teach how to use, although Winny was made for a research purpose and usage is very difficult for normal users.</p>
  <p>Isamu warned not to share illegal things. But some users abused Winny, also some major publishers published books and magazines which sensationally incite share illegal files on Winny network. Copyright holders concerned the situation and extensively investigate to identify illegal users. November 2003, two users were arrested for violating copyright by Kyoto prefectural police.</p>
  <p>Six months later, 2004 May 10, Isamu Kaneko was arrested for 'assisted two illegal users by created Winny'. We consider the arrest is arbitrary and unlawful.</p>

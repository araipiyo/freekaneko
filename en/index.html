<h1>FreeKaneko.com -- Free Isamu Kaneko</h1>
<div class="main">
  <p>Isamu Kaneko Ph.D., a very well-known software engineer and a research associate of Tokyo university, was arrested for creating a P2P software called 'Winny.' 'Winny' supports anonymous bulletin board and file-sharing.</p>
  <p>Creating file-sharing software is completely legal in Japan. Therefore, the police are justifying his arrest by alleging he 'assisted' two people who illegally uploaded copyrighted materials using 'Winny'. This kind of manipulation of the law is a very serious threat to our freedom and rights.</p>
  <p>Isamu was arrested May 10, 2004 in Tokyo, by Kyoto prefectural police, and bailed Jun 1, 2004. The case is under trial now at Kyoto district court.</p>
